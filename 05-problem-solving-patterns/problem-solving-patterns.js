// Frequency counters

// This pattern uses objects or sets collects values/frequencies of values.
// This can often avoud the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with array/strings.

// Same
// Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays.
// The function should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the 2nd array.
// The frequency of values must be the same.
