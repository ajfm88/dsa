# SQL Lesson 18: Dropping tables

Source: https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/dropping_tables

In some rare cases, you may want to remove an entire table including all of its data and metadata, and to do so, you can use the `DROP TABLE` statement, which differs from the `DELETE` statement in that it also removes the table schema from the database entirely.

## Drop table statement

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable;
```

Like the `CREATE TABLE` statement, the database may throw an error if the specified table does not exist, and to suppress that error, you can use the `IF EXISTS` clause.

In addition, if you have another table that is dependent on columns in table you are removing (for example, with a `FOREIGN KEY` dependency) then you will have to either update all dependent tables first to remove the dependent rows or to remove those tables entirely.

## Exercise

We've reached the end of our exercises, so lets clean up by removing all the tables we've worked with.

**Table: Movies**

### Tasks

1. We've sadly reached the end of our lessons, lets clean up by removing the **Movies** table
2. And drop the **BoxOffice** table as well
