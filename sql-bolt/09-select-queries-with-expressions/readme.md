# SQL Lesson 9: Queries with expressions

Source: https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_expressions

In addition to querying and referencing raw column data with SQL, you can also use *expressions* to write more complex logic on column values in a query. These expressions can use mathematical and string functions along with basic arithmetic to transform values when the query is executed, as shown in this physics example.

## Example query with expressions

```sql
SELECT particle_speed / 2.0 AS half_particle_speed
FROM physics_data
WHERE ABS(particle_position) * 10.0 > 500;
```

Each database has its own supported set of mathematical, string, and date functions that can be used in a query, which you can find in their own respective docs.

The use of expressions can save time and extra post-processing of the result data, but can also make the query harder to read, so we recommend that when expressions are used in the `SELECT` part of the query, that they are also given a descriptive *alias* using the `AS` keyword.

## Select query with expression aliases

```sql
SELECT col_expression AS expr_description, …
FROM mytable;
```

In addition to expressions, regular columns and even tables can also have aliases to make them easier to reference in the output and as a part of simplifying more complex queries.

## Example query with both column and table name aliases

```sql
SELECT column AS better_column_name, …
FROM a_long_widgets_table_name AS mywidgets
INNER JOIN widget_sales
    ON mywidgets.id = widget_sales.widget_id;
```

## Exercise

You are going to have to use expressions to transform the **BoxOffice** data into something easier to understand for the tasks below.
